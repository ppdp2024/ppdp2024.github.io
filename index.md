Scope
-----

The PPDP 2024 symposium brings together researchers from the
declarative programming communities, including those working in the
functional, logic, answer-set, and constraint handling programming
paradigms. The goal is to stimulate research in the use of logical
formalisms and methods for analyzing, performing, specifying, and
reasoning about computations, including mechanisms for concurrency,
security, static analysis, and verification.

Submissions are invited on all topics related to declarative
programming, from principles to practice, from foundations to
applications. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Language Design: domain-specific languages; interoperability;
concurrency, parallelism and distribution; modules; functional
languages; reactive languages; languages with objects; languages for
quantum computing; languages inspired by biological and chemical
computation; metaprogramming.

- Declarative languages in artificial intelligence: logic programming;
database languages; knowledge representation languages;
probabilistic languages; differentiable languages.

- Implementations: abstract machines; interpreters; compilation;
compile-time and run-time optimization; memory management.

- Foundations: types; logical frameworks; monads and effects;
semantics.

- Analysis and Transformation: partial evaluation; abstract
interpretation; control flow; data flow; information flow;
termination analysis; resource analysis; type inference and type
checking; verification; validation; debugging; testing.

- Tools and Applications: programming and proof environments;
verification tools; case studies in proof assistants or interactive
theorem provers; certification; novel applications of declarative
programming inside and outside of CS; declarative programming
pearls; practical experience reports and industrial application;
education.
<!---
The PC chairs will be happy to advise on the appropriateness of a topic.

PPDP will take place 10-11 September 2024 at the Politecnico di Milano,
Italy, co-located with the 34th Int'l Symp. on Logic-Based Program
Synthesis and Transformation ([LOPSTR 2024](https://lopstr.github.io/2024/))
within the umbrella of [FM 2024](https://www.fm24.polimi.it/)

Submission 
---------------

Via EasyChair at this [link](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ppdp24)
-->

Submission Categories
---------------------

Submissions can be made in three categories:

- Regular Research Papers,
- System Descriptions, and
- Experience Reports.

<!-- 
Submissions of Research Papers must present original research which is
unpublished and not submitted elsewhere. They must not exceed 12 pages
ACM style 2-column (including figures, but excluding bibliography).
Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally
published workshop proceedings may be submitted (please contact the PC
chair in case of questions). Research papers will be judged on
originality, significance, correctness, clarity, and readability.

Submission of System Descriptions must describe a working system whose
description has not been published or submitted elsewhere. They must
not exceed 10 pages and should contain a link to a working
system. System Descriptions must be marked as such at the time of
submission and will be judged on originality, significance,
usefulness, clarity, and readability.

Submissions of Experience Reports are meant to help create a body of
published, refereed, citable evidence where declarative programming
such as functional, logic, answer-set, constraint programming, etc.,
is used in practice. They must not exceed 5 pages **including references**.
Experience Reports must be marked as such at the time
of submission and need not report original research results. They will
be judged on significance, usefulness, clarity, and readability.

Possible topics for an Experience Report include, but are not limited to:

- insights gained from real-world projects using declarative
programming

- comparison of declarative programming with conventional
programming in the context of an industrial project or a
university curriculum

- curricular issues encountered when using declarative programming
in education

- real-world constraints that created special challenges for an
implementation of a declarative language or for declarative
programming in general

- novel use of declarative programming in the classroom

- programming pearl that illustrates a nifty new data structure or
programming technique.

Supplementary material may be provided via a link to an extended
version of the submission (recommended), or in a clearly marked appendix
beyond the above-mentioned page limits. Reviewers are not required to
study extended versions or any material beyond the respective page
limit. Material beyond the page limit will not be included in the
final published version.
-->

Proceedings
----------------------

The PPDP 2024 proceedings, ISBN 9-8-4007-0969-297, will be published in the ACM Digital Library within the ACM International Conference Proceedings Series.

Important note to authors about the new ACM open access publishing model
--------------------

ACM has introduced a new open access publishing model for the
International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS). Authors based at
institutions that are not yet part of the ACM Open program and do not
qualify for a waiver will be required to pay an article processing
charge (APC) to publish their ICPS article in the ACM Digital
Library. To determine whether or not an APC will be applicable to your
article, please follow the detailed guidance [here](https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/author-guidance).

Further information may be found on the ACM website, as follows:

- Full details of the new [ICPS publishing model](https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/faq)
- Full details of the [ACM Open program](https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess). Please direct all questions about the new model [here](mailto:icps-info@acm.org).

Format of a submission
----------------------

For each paper category, you must use the most recent version of the
[Current ACM Master
Template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template),
 at the time of writing being 2.08. You must use the
LaTeX sigconf proceedings template, as the conference organizers are
unable to process final submissions in other formats. In case of
problems with the templates, contact [ACM's TeX support team at
Aptara](mailto:acmtexsupport@aptaracorp.com).

Authors should note [ACM's statement on author's
rights](http://authors.acm.org/) which apply to final papers.
Submitted papers should meet the requirements of [ACM's plagiarism
policy](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy).

Requirements for publication
----------------------------

At least one author of each accepted submission will be expected to
attend and present the work at the conference. The PC chair may
retract a paper that is not presented. The PC chair may also retract a
paper if complaints about the paper's correctness are raised which
cannot be resolved by the final paper deadline.
