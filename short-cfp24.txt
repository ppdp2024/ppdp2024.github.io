The PPDP 2024 symposium brings together researchers from the
declarative programming communities, including those working in the
functional, logic, answer-set, and constraint handling programming
paradigms. The goal is to stimulate research in the use of logical
formalisms and methods for analyzing, performing, specifying, and
reasoning about computations, including mechanisms for concurrency,
security, static analysis, and verification.

Submissions can be made in three categories:

- Regular Research Papers,
- System Descriptions, and
- Experience Reports.

The PPDP 2024 proceedings will published in the ACM Digital Library
within the ACM International Conference Proceedings Series.
